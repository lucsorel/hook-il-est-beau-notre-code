== Some major features

[.column]
--
* faster python interpreter: 10-60% faster than 3.10
* improved Exception management (grouping except clauses, fine-grained tracebacks)
* extended regexp syntax (now includes atomic grouping and possessive quantifiers - don't ask me!)
--

[.column]
--
* asyncio: introduced task groups as a context manager within which coroutines are launched and executed. The context manager ends when all coroutines are done
* Self type annotation to get rid of fast-forward references as string: helps building fluent APIs (when setters returns the current instance of a class) for example
--

[.column]
--
* dataclass_transform decorator, to provide a unified approach to all @dataclass-like approaches that help ease the construction of classes
* some advanced type annotations ("variadic generics", they call them)
